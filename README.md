# Smart Groom: Hairstyle Recommendation and Try-On System

Smart Groom is an AI-powered application that revolutionizes the way users choose hairstyles by providing personalized hairstyle recommendations based on their face shape. The application includes a real-time hairstyle try-on feature, allowing users to visualize how a hairstyle looks on them before committing to a salon appointment. This project combines computer vision, machine learning, and modern app development to enhance user experience and redefine personal styling.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Features**

1. **Face Shape Detection**:
   - The system uses a machine learning model trained to detect the user's face shape (e.g., oval, square, round, etc.) from an uploaded photo.
   - This forms the basis for personalized hairstyle recommendations.

2. **Hairstyle Recommendation**:
   - Based on the detected face shape, the system suggests the six most suitable hairstyles from a curated dataset.
   - Recommendations are backed by research on what hairstyles best complement each face shape.

3. **Real-Time Hairstyle Try-On**:
   - Users can upload their own image and select a hairstyle to apply.
   - The application uses a face swap API to superimpose the chosen hairstyle onto the user‚Äôs face, providing a realistic preview.

4. **Feedback Integration**:
   - Users can rate and provide feedback on the suggested hairstyles.
   - Feedback is used to enhance the recommendation model, ensuring better suggestions in the future.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The app includes an interactive and visually appealing Flutter-based frontend.
   - Users can book salon appointments and download hairstyle previews.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **1. Input Phase**
   - The user uploads an image of their face to the app.
   - Optional: Users can specify their styling preferences.

### **2. Face Shape Detection**
   - The backend processes the uploaded image using a machine learning model.
   - Dlib and face recognition libraries are utilized to extract facial landmarks and determine the face shape.

### **3. Hairstyle Recommendation**
   - Based on the detected face shape, the system retrieves hairstyle recommendations from the dataset.
   - The recommendations are displayed in a user-friendly format.

### **4. Hairstyle Try-On**
   - When the user selects a recommended hairstyle, the app sends the user's face image and the selected hairstyle to a face swap API.
   - The API generates a merged image, showing the user with the chosen hairstyle.

### **5. Feedback**
   - Users can provide feedback by rating the suggestions, helping improve the accuracy and quality of future recommendations.
